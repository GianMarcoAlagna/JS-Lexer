# JS-Lexer
This isn't meant to be a real well formed lexer, just practice and interest in the logic behind languages.

The parser is using top-down recursive decent.
The lexer uses a pretty naive method of tokenizing the input file, but this can be fixed, for now it's strictly for developing the parser itself.
